# Functions

**JavaScript**
- Just include `Functions.js` to your `<body>` element in your HTML file, like this: 
```html
<script src="./path/to/Functions.js"></script>
```

- And don't forget to add `type=module` to your main Javascript script element, like this:
  ```html
  <script type=module src="./path/to/your/main.js"></script>
  ```

---


**C++**

-  Just include the `Functions.h` header, like this: 
```c++
#include "./path/to/cpp/Functions.h"
```
- And thats really it, C++ will import the rest, but remember to compile Functions.cpp, the file that is included with the similar named header.
